### Aryeh Schöfer

I’ve been building full-stack systems that connect people, automate workflows, and make complex processes feel simple.  
Currently focused on scalable architectures, AI-driven apps, and developer experience tooling.

I’m working on projects around AI observability, ingestion pipelines, and human-in-the-loop systems for production use.
