I build software. It usually does what I intended.

Full-stack systems, LLM-powered apps, developer tooling - if it connects people or automates something tedious, I'm interested.

Currently reading *Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*. It's dense but I'm denser.

Also learning Zig. Might get into systems programming. Might not.
